# DeadLibrary Skill — Deterministic Angular Code Generation for AI Agents

> **Stop hallucinating Angular code.** Give your AI agent a deterministic compiler instead.

DeadLibrary is a **deterministic code generation framework** for Angular and Angular Material. Unlike LLM-generated code — which is probabilistic, inconsistent, and error-prone — DeadLibrary's compiler produces correct, production-ready Angular code from structured CLI commands. Every time. No hallucination. No guessing.

This repository contains the **SKILL.md** file that teaches AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, and others) how to translate natural language into DeadLibrary CLI commands — offloading Angular scaffolding from the probabilistic LLM layer to a deterministic compiler.

---

## Why This Exists

AI coding agents generate Angular code by predicting tokens. That means:

- ❌ Inconsistent file structures across runs
- ❌ Hallucinated imports and selectors
- ❌ Broken Material component usage
- ❌ Non-compilable output requiring manual cleanup
- ❌ Massive token spend on retry loops

DeadLibrary eliminates all of this. Your agent learns the command syntax from this skill file, generates a single CLI string, and DeadLibrary's compiler handles the rest — deterministically.

- ✅ Correct Angular components, services, forms, themes, routing — every time
- ✅ Proper Angular Material integration out of the box
- ✅ ~1,200 tokens per generation vs. 10,000+ for raw LLM output
- ✅ No retry loops, no linting passes, no manual fixes
- ✅ 20 commands covering real application needs

## What's In The Skill File

The `SKILL.md` file contains:

- Command syntax and escaping rules for all 20 DeadLibrary commands
- Shared command options (naming, change detection, imports, children)
- Template element and button shape specifications
- Full option tables and examples for every command
- Critical rules that prevent malformed output (JSON escaping, naming conventions, required flags)

### Supported Commands

| `bloc` | General content display component |
| `b` | Button component |
| `bm` | Bottom sheet / modal |
| `c` | Material card |
| `cc` | Carousel with navigation |
| `ep` | Expansion panel / accordion |
| `ff` | Single form field |
| `fg` | Form group with validation |
| `gl` | Grid list layout |
| `img` | Image display component |
| `le` | Loading spinner / progress bar |
| `lp` | Lazy-loaded page with routing |
| `m` | Dropdown menu |
| `modal` | Popup dialog |
| `mt` | Mobile toolbar |
| `sn` | Side navigation |
| `sv` | Angular services |
| `tabs` | Tabbed interface |
| `tbar` | Desktop toolbar |

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
# Clone into your skills directory
git clone https://github.com/deaddevelopment/deadlibrary-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/deadlibrary-skill
```

Or manually copy `SKILL.md` into `~/.claude/skills/deadlibrary-skill/SKILL.md`.

### Codex CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deaddevelopment/deadlibrary-skill.git ~/.codex/skills/deadlibrary-skill
```

### Cursor / Windsurf / Other Agents

Add the `SKILL.md` file to your agent's context, custom instructions, or rules directory per your tool's documentation.

### Manual

Download `SKILL.md` from this repo and include it in your agent's system prompt or skill configuration.

## Quick Example

**You say:**
> "Build me a contact form with name, email, and message fields and a send button"

**Your agent outputs:**
```
dead g "fg -n contact-form -g contactGroup --language angular-20 -f [{"lbl":{"val":"Name"},"input":{"sel":"input","fieldType":"mat-input","required":true}},{"lbl":{"val":"Email"},"input":{"sel":"input","fieldType":"mat-input","inputType":"email","required":true,"validator":"Validators.email"}},{"lbl":{"val":"Message"},"input":{"sel":"mat-textarea","fieldType":"mat-textarea"}}] -b [{"lbl":"Send","type":"mat-flat-button","fn":"onSubmit()"}]"
```

**DeadLibrary compiles:** A complete Angular component with FormGroup, reactive form controls, Material form fields, validation, and a submit handler. Correct. Every time.

## How It Works

```
Developer Intent  →  AI Agent (reads SKILL.md)  →  CLI Command String  →  DeadLibrary Compiler  →  Production Angular Code Written to Current Working Directory
     (natural         (probabilistic layer:           (deterministic           (deterministic            (correct, every
      language)         intent translation)              input)                  compilation)               time)
```

The AI handles what it's good at — understanding intent. DeadLibrary handles what requires determinism — generating code. This is **Command-Based Development**: separating the probabilistic from the deterministic.
